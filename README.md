Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of 23,171 airline customer reviews to understand the factors influencing whether passengers recommend an airline. The dataset contains 20 variables, including numerical ratings, categorical information, textual reviews, and a Boolean target variable indicating if a customer recommends the airline.

Data Understanding and Preparation started with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis. The dataset included detailed information such as overall ratings, seat comfort, cabin staff service, food quality, WiFi connectivity, and customer demographics. All variables were checked for completeness, data types, and distribution.

Missing values were handled thoughtfully:

For categorical and Boolean variables, missing entries were replaced with 'Unknown' or empty strings to preserve context.

For numerical features, missing values were imputed using the mean rating within each airline group, ensuring realistic and airline-specific estimates that avoid bias from zeros or arbitrary values.

Initial textual analysis of reviews revealed frequently occurring words such as “flight,” “airline,” “service,” and “staff,” highlighting common customer concerns.

Descriptive statistics uncovered important insights:

Passenger experiences tend to be generally poor, with low average ratings for seat comfort and food & beverages.

Cabin staff service ratings are comparatively better but still indicate room for improvement.

WiFi and inflight entertainment services received consistently low scores, suggesting areas for significant enhancement.

High variability in ratings points to inconsistent service quality, reflecting a mix of both excellent and poor customer experiences.

These findings set the stage for subsequent predictive modeling and sentiment analysis aimed at identifying key drivers of customer recommendations. The insights will help airlines improve targeted services, enhance customer satisfaction, and inform business strategies.
